## How can you contribute?

1. Fork this repo
2. clone your version of the repo
3. create a new-branch and switch to it. The branch name should be your username of your github account. Well, you just have to create a **README**.**md** file and add small description/about of this repo and usage. For example https://github.com/50UM3N/darksky-weather-app/blob/master/README.md.
4. add, commit and push the change
5. create a pull request!
6. Follow me on GitHub ðŸ˜‹ (obviously an optional step :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: ).
